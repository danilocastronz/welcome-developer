# Welcome, Developer

I'm Dan Castro, a Brazilian guy exploring New Zealand. Nice to meet you. I'm a developer, just like you!

Let's talk about web development, data vizualization, cloud computing, DevOps, and... you know, everything that keeps us awake until late at night ðŸ¦‰

All developers are invited to [Welcome, Developer](https://www.welcomedeveloper.com) ðŸ–– This is the repo for the applications we built together throughout our posts!

Follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/welcome-developer) to stay tuned!

You are welcome to connect with me through my [personal LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danilovcastro/) page.
