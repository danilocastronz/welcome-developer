# Welcome, Developer - Code Repository

<hr/>

‚ö†Ô∏è This repository has been depricated. Instead, now it is available a new repository per post written on the [Welcome, Developer](https://www.welcomedeveloper.com) blog.

<hr/>

I'm Dan Castro, a Brazilian guy exploring New Zealand. Nice to meet you. I'm a developer, just like you!

Let's talk about web development, data vizualization, cloud computing, DevOps, and... you know, everything that keeps us awake until late at night ü¶â

All developers are invited to [Welcome, Developer](https://www.welcomedeveloper.com) üññ

Follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/welcome-developer) to stay tuned!

You are welcome to connect with me through my [personal LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danilovcastro/) page.
