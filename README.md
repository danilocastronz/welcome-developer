# Welcome, Developer

I'm Dan Castro, a Brazilian guy exploring New Zealand. I invite you to join me on the infinite journey of studying technology.

Let's talk about web dev, data viz, cloud, data science, and... you know, everything that keep us awake late nights. All developers are welcome!

I will be adding to this repository all the applications and exercises that we build together through the posts of [Welcome, Developer](https://www.welcomedeveloper.com/).

Stay tuned, you are welcome to invite or follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danilovcastro/)
